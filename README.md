# AceBook - Fishbook

This is a collaborative project called Fishbook, an aquatic themed clone of the social media platform Facebook written using Ruby-on-rails as part of the engineering weeks at Makers Academy. Through this project, we learned how to work effectively and efficiently as a team, and were able to meet all requirements for the project with 100% test coverage.

## Functionality

 A new user must sign up with an email and password, their first, last, and user-name, and can specify a profile picture, after which they will be redirected to the homepage, where all posts are listed.

 A user is able to edit or delete their account, either from the homepage or from their profile.

A user can create a post on the homepage, on their profile page, or on another user's profile page. Posts can be edited, deleted, commented on, liked, and disliked (one like/dislike per user). A live notification feed updates whenever a user performs one of these actions. Only the user who created a post can edit or delete it.

Any user's avatar can be clicked on, redirecting to their profile page.

## Standups and Retrospectives

As part of our day-to-day planning, we would have morning stand-ups to discuss the aims for that day and assign tasks, as well as afternoon retrospectives to reflect on what we had achieved/learned/had difficulty with. This helped us articulate and overcome problems we perceived would be blockers, and ultimately led to increased productivity.


## Card Wall
We used a Trello card wall to organise our 2 day sprints. Every ticket was estimated before being worked on, and each ticket was assigned to a pair or a three, and in some cases a solo developer.
