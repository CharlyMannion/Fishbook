## Functionality

 A new user must sign up with an email and password, their first, last, and user-name, and can specify a profile picture, after which they will be redirected to the homepage, where all posts are listed.

 A user is able to edit or delete their account, either from the homepage or from their profile.

A user can create a post on the homepage, on their profile page, or on another user's profile page. Posts can be edited, deleted, commented on, liked, and disliked (one like/dislike per user). A live notification feed updates whenever a user performs one of these actions. Only the user who created a post can edit or delete it.

Any user's avatar can be clicked on, redirecting to their profile page.


## Card Wall
We used a Trello card wall to organise our 2 day sprints. Every ticket was estimated before being worked on, and each ticket was assigned to a pair or a three, and in some cases a solo developer.
